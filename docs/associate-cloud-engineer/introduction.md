## Before the cloud - Scenario

Consider an online shopping site hosted on an on-premises server. The site functions normally, but when Christmas arrives, the site's traffic increases rapidly! What will be done to satisfy the sudden increase in traffic?

We need to buy infrastrcuture for peak load, also called **PEAK LOAD provisioning**

So, once the traffic is reduced, what will the infrastructure do?

## Before the cloud - Challenges

- High cost for buying infrastructure
- Needs ahead of time planning (Can you guess the future?)
- Low infrastructure utilization
- Dedicated infrastructure maintainence team

## Cloud intro

How about provisioning (renting) resources when you want them and releasing them back when you don't need them? 
  - On-demand resource provisioning
  - Elasticity

## Cloud - Advantages

- Pay only for what you use
- Auto-scaling
- No need to spend money for data center maintenance
- Can create resources globally in minutes

## GCP (Google Cloud Platform)

- One of the top 3 cloud service providers
- Infrastructure that powers 8 services with over 1 billion users: Gmail, Google search, Youtube etc
- Net carbon-neutral cloud
