# AWS Lake Formation
- **Data lake = central place to have all your data for analytics purpose**
- Fully managed service that makes it easy to setup a **data lake** in days
- It automates many complex manual steps (collecting, cleansing, moving, cataloging data...) and de-duplicate (using ML transforms)
- Combine structured and un-structured data in data lake
- **Out of the box source blueprints:** S3, RDS, relational and NoSQL db...
- Fine grained access control for your applications (row and column-level)
- Built on top of AWS glue
- Can be used as a centralised place to manage permissions/access control
